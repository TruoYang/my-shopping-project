## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

**My Shopping Project** is a fullstack e-commerce web application built with:

- **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) combined with [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for building a modern, responsive, and component-based user interface.
- **Backend**: [Strapi](https://strapi.io/), a headless CMS that provides a user-friendly interface to manage content and APIs.

This project is designed as a personal learning experience to sharpen my fullstack development skills, from frontend implementation to backend integration.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- **Improve coding skills**: Practice writing clean, structured, and maintainable code.
- **Understand frontend-backend connection**: Learn how to handle API integration and data flow between the UI and backend.
- **Use async/await properly**: Gain experience in managing asynchronous operations effectively in JavaScript.
- **Simulate fullstack development**: Take responsibility for both UI/UX and data logic, like a real-world fullstack developer.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **Next.js**: A React-based framework supporting SSR and SSG for better SEO and performance.
- **Shadcn UI**: A collection of beautifully designed UI components built with Tailwind CSS.
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building component-driven UIs.

### Backend

- **Strapi**: An open-source headless CMS to manage structured content and expose APIs.
- **RESTful API**: Strapi provides easy-to-use REST endpoints to connect with the frontend.
